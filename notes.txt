Notes:
- account balance can be represented with integer
- would want to integrate with real system: security needed
- testing controller is within scope of project
  - making sure cant withdraw during invalid session
  - session timeout
  - make sure can't withdraw more than what is available
  - make sure user can't input strange values to mess up machine
- would want to integrate with real cash bin in future
- need to send PIN input, withdrawal request to bank for approval/verification
  - not sure how to secure that request on my end
- would want some way to interrupt the session, declare it invalid






Assumption:
- user will be unable to grab their card once inserted
-
